    "### Notes\n",
    "- This assignment should be submitted in Canvas as a format of ipython notebook (assignment3.ipynb).\n",
    "- No late assignments will be accepted. Do not accept any other format. Minimum penalty is 2pts with acceptable excuse.\n",
    "- You may collaborate on homework but must independently write code/solutions. Copying and other forms of cheating will not be tolerated and will result in a zero score for the homework (minimal penalty) or a failing grade for the course.\n",
    "- Your work will be graded in terms of correctness, completeness, and clarity, not just the answer. Thus, correct answers with no or poorly written supporting steps may receive very little credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOTE: Please do not use any open-source algorithm for gradient decent method. Instead, you need to write gradient descent method from scratch."
